## If you are looking for ways to hide some specific rows and columns from specific users in qlik sense, the following could 
help you.

### step1:set user's access to **data** on row and column level


section access;
LOAD * inline [
ACCESS, USERID,REDUCTION, OMIT    
USER, AD_DOMAIN\ADMIN,,
USER, AD_DOMAIN\A,1,
USER, AD_DOMAIN\B, 2,NUM
USER, AD_DOMAIN\C, 3, ALPHA
ADMIN, INTERNAL\SA_SCHEDULER,*,
];
section application;


 ### reduction:define which row to hide, omit:define which column to hide
 ### note: here we only hide measurement, not dimensions(the report will have visual problems if we omit dimension, details 
 pls refer to qlik help website)
 
 
 ### step2: afer step1, the colunm will still stay in the report for those specific users, but the measurement all equals = 0,
 which means the first step works but not very user friendly, and sometimes biz don't want users aware of there are autority 
 difference among them, so here is step2 adjustment on report level.
